### Slide 1: Title Slide

**Title:** VIBE Context Management  
**Subtitle:** Understanding AI Memory and Context Preservation  
**Author:** [Your Name]  
**Date:** October 2025

**Visual Suggestion:** Brain/memory icon with flowing data streams

---

### Slide 2: What is Context in AI?

**Title:** Understanding AI Context

**Definition:**
Context is the **working memory** AI uses to understand and respond to your requests.

**Context Includes:**

- 📝 **Conversation History** - Previous messages and responses
- 📁 **File Contents** - Code, documentation, configuration files
- 🎯 **System Instructions** - How the AI should behave
- 🔧 **Tool Definitions** - Available functions and capabilities
- 📊 **Project Information** - Architecture, patterns, constraints

**Visual Suggestion:** Circular diagram showing different context components flowing into AI "brain"

---

### Slide 3: The Context Challenge

**Title:** Why Context Management Matters

**The Problem:**
AI systems have **limited context windows** (e.g., 200,000 tokens)

**What Happens When Limits Are Reached:**

- 🗑️ Old information gets compressed or removed
- 🔀 Critical decisions may be forgotten
- 📉 Quality and consistency degrade
- ⚠️ Patterns and standards get lost

**Real Impact:**

```
Developer: "Remember, we use enableDelay: false"
[50 messages later...]
AI: "Let me add enableDelay: true to the config"
Result: Inconsistent implementation
```

**Visual Suggestion:** Overflowing container with information spilling out

---

### Slide 4: Context Window Anatomy

**Title:** Inside the Context Window

**Token Budget Distribution:**

```
Total Limit: 200,000 tokens (100%)
├── System Instructions:    5,000 tokens  (2.5%)
├── Tool Definitions:      15,000 tokens  (7.5%)
├── Recent Conversation:   50,000 tokens (25.0%)
├── File Contents:        100,000 tokens (50.0%)
├── Historical Context:    25,000 tokens (12.5%)
└── Response Buffer:        5,000 tokens  (2.5%)
```

**Key Insight:** Only ~50% of context is available for your project content!

**Visual Suggestion:** Pie chart or stacked bar showing token allocation

---

### Slide 5: Sliding Window Approach

**Title:** How AI Manages Context Over Time

**The Sliding Window Concept:**

```
Time →  [Msg1][Msg2][Msg3][Msg4][Msg5][Msg6][Msg7][Msg8]
                       ↓
Context Window: [━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━]
                       ↓
As new content arrives, old content gets compressed:
Updated Window: [Summary][Msg5][Msg6][Msg7][Msg8][New]
```

**What This Means:**

- **Recent information** is preserved in full
- **Older information** gets compressed or summarized
- **Ancient information** may be completely removed
- **Context shifts** over time as conversation progresses

**Visual Suggestion:** Animated sliding window with messages moving through it

---

### Slide 6: Context Priority Hierarchy

**Title:** What Gets Kept, What Gets Removed

**Priority Levels (High to Low):**

**🔴 Always Kept:**

- System instructions and core functionality
- Current task context and active files

**🟡 Usually Kept:**

- Recent conversation (last 10-20 messages)
- Established patterns and decisions
- Key constraints and requirements

**🟢 Sometimes Kept:**

- Historical debugging sessions
- Old file versions
- Background discussions

**⚪ Often Removed:**

- Outdated information
- Redundant explanations
- Superseded decisions

**Visual Suggestion:** Pyramid showing priority hierarchy

---

### Slide 7: Context Compaction Triggers

**Title:** When Does Context Get Compressed?

**Three Main Triggers:**

**1. Token Limit Approached**

- Typically at 80-90% capacity
- Proactive compression before hitting hard limit
- Prevents abrupt information loss

**2. New Content Needs Space**

- Large files need to be read
- Complex tool outputs generated
- Extensive new requirements provided

**3. Context Quality Degrades**

- Too much outdated information
- Conflicting or redundant context
- Signal-to-noise ratio drops

**Visual Suggestion:** Warning gauges showing different trigger thresholds

---

### Slide 8: Compaction Methods - Summarization

**Title:** Method 1: Summarization

**How It Works:**

```
Before Compression:
"We discussed implementing authentication with JWT tokens.
After evaluating several approaches including sessions,
OAuth2, and basic auth, we decided on JWT because it's
stateless and works well with our microservices architecture.
We'll store tokens in httpOnly cookies for security and
implement refresh token rotation every 7 days..."
[10,000 tokens total]

After Summarization:
"Auth implementation: JWT tokens in httpOnly cookies,
7-day refresh rotation, stateless for microservices."
[1,000 tokens total]
```

**Characteristics:**

- 📊 **Compression Ratio:** 10:1 typical
- ⚠️ **Information Loss:** Medium
- 💡 **Best For:** Long discussions with key decisions
- ✅ **Preserves:** Main points and conclusions

**Visual Suggestion:** Funnel showing information being condensed

---

### Slide 9: Compaction Methods - Truncation

**Title:** Method 2: Truncation

**How It Works:**

```
Before Truncation:
[Full file: 15,000 tokens]
- Header and imports (2,000 tokens)
- Core functionality (8,000 tokens)
- Helper functions (3,000 tokens)
- Footer and exports (2,000 tokens)

After Truncation:
[First 5,000 tokens]
- Header and imports (2,000 tokens)
- Core functionality (3,000 tokens)
- "...content truncated..."
[Missing: 10,000 tokens]
```

**Characteristics:**

- 📊 **Compression Ratio:** 3:1 typical
- ⚠️ **Information Loss:** High
- 💡 **Best For:** Large files where beginning has context
- ❌ **Problem:** May lose critical information in middle/end

**Visual Suggestion:** Document being cut with scissors, lower portion fading

---

### Slide 10: Compaction Methods - Selective Removal

**Title:** Method 3: Selective Removal

**How It Works:**

```
Before Removal:
- File_v1.tsx (old version, 5,000 tokens)
- File_v2.tsx (current version, 5,000 tokens)
- Debug session from 2 days ago (3,000 tokens)
- Recent test results (2,000 tokens)
- Current implementation discussion (8,000 tokens)

After Selective Removal:
- File_v2.tsx (current version, 5,000 tokens)
- Recent test results (2,000 tokens)
- Current implementation discussion (8,000 tokens)
[Removed: outdated file version and old debug session]
```

**Characteristics:**

- 📊 **Compression Ratio:** Variable (2:1 to 5:1)
- ⚠️ **Information Loss:** Low (targeted)
- 💡 **Best For:** Multiple versions or redundant content
- ✅ **Most Intelligent:** Removes only truly outdated information

**Visual Suggestion:** Files being sorted, some moved to trash, others kept

---

### Slide 11: Context Fragmentation Risk

**Title:** The Danger of Fragmented Context

**What Happens:**

```
Original Complete Context:
"We established that MSW handlers should use enableDelay: false
for tests, and database cleanup should use clearDatabase() only,
not forceResetDatabase(). This was decided in the testing
optimization phase to achieve < 5 second test execution."

After Compaction (Fragmented):
"Use enableDelay: false and clearDatabase()."

Lost Critical Information:
❌ Why these decisions were made
❌ What alternatives were considered
❌ Context of the testing optimization phase
❌ Performance goals driving the decisions
```

**Real-World Impact:**

- AI may suggest alternatives without understanding why current approach was chosen
- Patterns get applied without understanding their purpose
- Quality standards lose their rationale

**Visual Suggestion:** Puzzle pieces with some missing, showing incomplete picture

---

### Slide 12: Pattern Forgetting

**Title:** Consistency Impact: Pattern Forgetting

**The Problem:**

```
Conversation Timeline:

Message 5: "Always use enableDelay: false for tests"
Message 10: ✅ AI implements with enableDelay: false
Message 30: ✅ AI still remembers the pattern
Message 60: ⚠️ Context compaction occurs
Message 65: ❌ AI suggests enableDelay: true
Message 70: 🔧 Manual correction needed
```

**Why It Happens:**

- Original decision gets compressed out
- Rationale is lost, only implementation remains
- AI reverts to default patterns
- Inconsistency introduced into codebase

**Visual Suggestion:** Timeline showing pattern degradation over conversation

---

### Slide 13: Architecture Drift

**Title:** Consistency Impact: Architecture Drift

**The Problem:**

```
Established Architecture:
"Use React Context for state management"
✅ Consistent with project patterns
✅ Fits existing codebase structure
✅ Team has expertise

After Context Loss:
AI Suggestion: "Let's use Redux for this feature"
❌ Introduces new dependency
❌ Inconsistent with existing approach
❌ Creates architectural inconsistency
```

**Severity:** **VERY HIGH**

- Harder to fix than pattern forgetting
- Affects multiple files and components
- Can require significant refactoring
- Creates technical debt

**Visual Suggestion:** Building with mismatched architectural styles

---

### Slide 14: Convention Inconsistency

**Title:** Consistency Impact: Convention Inconsistency

**The Problem:**

```
Established Convention:
"File naming: parentComponent + descriptive suffix"
Example: houseTemperatures.tsx → houseTemperaturesRoomDialog.tsx

After Context Loss:
AI Suggestions:
❌ roomDialog.tsx (too generic)
❌ room-dialog.tsx (wrong case convention)
❌ HouseTemperaturesRoom.tsx (wrong pattern)

Result:
Codebase becomes harder to navigate and maintain
```

**Impact Level:** Medium

- Easier to fix than architecture drift
- But affects code organization
- Reduces codebase readability

**Visual Suggestion:** Files with inconsistent naming patterns

---

### Slide 15: Quality Degradation Patterns

**Title:** How Quality Degrades Over Time

**Pattern 1: Gradual Degradation**

```
Quality Level
     ↑
100% |████████████░░░░░░░░░░░░░░
 80% |████████████████░░░░░░░░░░
 60% |████████████████████░░░░░░
 40% |████████████████████████░░
 20% |██████████████████████████
     └────────────────────────→
       Time / Messages
```

**Characteristics:**

- Slow, steady decline
- Hard to notice until significant
- Easier to course-correct
- Preventable with periodic reinforcement

**Pattern 2: Sudden Drops**

```
Quality Level
     ↑
100% |██████████████████████████
 80% |██████████████████████████
 60% |██████████████████████████
 40% |████████░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░ ← Compaction Event
 20% |████████░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░
     └────────────────────────→
       Compaction Events
```

**Characteristics:**

- Dramatic quality drop at compaction
- Very noticeable to developers
- Requires immediate intervention
- Often needs conversation restart

**Visual Suggestion:** Two line graphs showing different degradation patterns

---

### Slide 16: Impact Severity Matrix

**Title:** Understanding Impact by Context Type

**Severity Table:**

| Context Type           | Impact Level | Recovery Difficulty | Example                   |
| ---------------------- | ------------ | ------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Code Patterns          | 🔴 High      | 🟡 Medium           | enableDelay config        |
| Architecture Decisions | 🔴 Very High | 🔴 Hard             | State management approach |
| File Locations         | 🟡 Medium    | 🟢 Easy             | Where components live     |
| Variable Names         | 🟢 Low       | 🟢 Easy             | Naming conventions        |
| Business Logic         | 🔴 High      | 🔴 Hard             | Complex algorithms        |
| Testing Patterns       | 🟡 Medium    | 🟡 Medium           | Test structure            |

**Key Insight:** Not all context loss is equal!

- Focus protection on high-impact, hard-to-recover areas
- Allow low-impact items to be compressed first
- Have recovery strategies for critical context types

**Visual Suggestion:** Heat map or color-coded matrix

---

### Slide 17: Context Management Strategy 1

**Title:** Strategy: Front-Load Critical Information

**The Approach:**

```markdown
# Essential Context (Always include first)

- Architecture: React + TypeScript + MSW
- Key Patterns: enableDelay: false, clearDatabase()
- File Structure: src/shared/mocks/handlers/
- Quality Standards: TypeScript strict mode

# Detailed Context (Include if space allows)

- Historical decisions and rationale
- Alternative approaches considered
- Implementation details and gotchas
```

**Why It Works:**

- ✅ Critical info less likely to be compressed
- ✅ Survives longer in sliding window
- ✅ Gets included in summaries
- ✅ First thing AI sees when processing

**Best Practice:** Treat first message like a project README

**Visual Suggestion:** Inverted pyramid showing critical info at top

---

### Slide 18: Context Management Strategy 2

**Title:** Strategy: Regular Context Checkpoints

**The Checkpoint Pattern:**

```
Every 5-10 exchanges:
1. Summarize current progress
2. Restate key constraints
3. Confirm established patterns
4. Plan next steps
```

**Example Checkpoint:**

```markdown
"Before continuing, let's confirm our approach:
✓ Using enableDelay: false for all tests
✓ Database cleanup with clearDatabase() only
✓ Component naming: parentComponent + suffix
✓ Current focus: Implementing auth components

Ready to proceed with login form component?"
```

**Benefits:**

- 🔄 Refreshes critical context regularly
- 📍 Creates natural conversation break points
- ✅ Validates mutual understanding
- 🛡️ Protects against gradual degradation

**Visual Suggestion:** Checkpoint flags along a roadmap

---

### Slide 19: Context Management Strategy 3

**Title:** Strategy: Use External Memory

**The Solution: Agent Files**

```
Project Root/
├── Agent.md (Master context document)
├── .agents/
│   ├── Frontend-Agent.md
│   ├── Backend-Agent.md
│   ├── Database-Agent.md
│   ├── Testing-Agent.md
│   ├── Infrastructure-Agent.md
│   └── LargeTask-Agent.md
└── Large_Task.md (Active planning document)
```

**How External Memory Helps:**

- 📁 **Persistent Storage:** Survives beyond conversation limits
- 📚 **Reference Library:** AI reads files when needed
- 🎯 **Context Loading:** Explicit context retrieval
- 🔄 **Reusable:** Same context across multiple sessions

**Key Principle:** **Store knowledge in files, not just conversations**

**Visual Suggestion:** Cloud storage icon with documents flowing to/from AI

---

### Slide 20: Context Management Strategy 4

**Title:** Strategy: Pattern Reinforcement

**The Reinforcement Protocol:**

**When to Reinforce:**

- ⚠️ AI suggests patterns previously rejected
- 🔀 Inconsistent naming conventions appear
- 📉 Quality standards seem forgotten
- ❓ AI asks about previously answered questions

**How to Reinforce:**

```markdown
"Stop - Let me reinforce our established patterns:

Critical Patterns (Non-negotiable):

- MSW: enableDelay: false in tests
- DB: clearDatabase() for cleanup
- Files: parentComponent naming
- Performance: < 5s test execution

Please apply these patterns to the solution."
```

**Visual Suggestion:** Stamp or seal indicating "reinforced patterns"

---

### Slide 21: Context Management Strategy 5

**Title:** Strategy: Context Handoff Protocol

**When Starting New Conversations:**

**Context Handoff Template:**

---

### Slide 24: Intervention Strategies

**Title:** When Context Loss Occurs

**Immediate Actions:**

**Level 1: Pattern Reinforcement**

```markdown
Signs: AI suggests enableDelay: true (was established as false)
Action: "Stop - we established enableDelay: false for test performance"
Severity: Low
Recovery: Quick reminder
```

**Level 2: Context Refresh**

```markdown
Signs: Multiple pattern inconsistencies
Action: Provide checkpoint summary with key patterns
Severity: Medium
Recovery: 2-3 message exchange
```

**Level 3: Conversation Reset**

```markdown
Signs: Fundamental misunderstanding of architecture
Action: Start new conversation with context handoff
Severity: High
Recovery: New conversation with proper context
```

**Decision Tree:**
