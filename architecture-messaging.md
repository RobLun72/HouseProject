You're weighing two reliability patterns for service-to-service calls: (1) outbox + message bus (async, event-driven) vs (2) direct calls with retries and an “error box” (sync with fallback/replay). Here’s a practical breakdown and where each fits best—tailored to your HouseService ↔ TemperatureService setup.

## Quick definitions

- Outbox + message bus: Write domain change + an “outbox” record in the same DB transaction; a background dispatcher publishes the outbox to a broker (RabbitMQ/Service Bus). Consumers process events asynchronously.
- Call retry + error box: Make a synchronous HTTP call; use resilient policies (retry/backoff/circuit breaker). On persistent failure, persist the failed intent in an “error box” store for later replay/repair.

## Outbox + message bus

Pros

- Atomicity across write + publish: Avoids dual-write race conditions; DB commit includes the outbox row.
- Loose coupling: Producers don’t block on consumers; services evolve independently (good for microservices).
- Backpressure and elasticity: Brokers buffer spikes; consumers scale horizontally.
- Resilience by design: DLQs, retries, poison-message isolation live in the broker; replay is first-class.
- Natural fit for eventual consistency: TemperatureService can stay in sync via events (you already have House/Room events defined).

Cons

- Eventual consistency: Data isn’t immediately consistent; callers may read stale data for a short window.
- Operational complexity: You run and observe a broker, outbox dispatcher, DLQs, handler retries, replays.
- Delivery semantics: Typically at-least-once; you need idempotency and deduplication at consumers.
- Extra moving parts: Outbox table, background publisher, schema versioning for events, handler evolution.

Best when

- State changes must be propagated reliably to many consumers.
- You need decoupling and scalability across services.
- Write workflows shouldn’t block on downstream services.
- You can tolerate eventual consistency (e.g., TemperatureService’s replicas).

Key practices

- Idempotent consumers (use unique event IDs or natural keys).
- Consumer-side “inbox” table or dedup cache to guard against reprocessing.
- Versioned event schemas; contract tests.
- Monitoring: broker metrics, DLQ length, outbox lag, handler failure rates.

## Direct call with retry + error box

Pros

- Simple mental model: Request/response with immediate outcome for the caller.
- Stronger “read-your-writes” feel: If the call returns OK, you know the other side applied it.
- No broker to manage: Fewer infra components if your system is small.
- Fits query use-cases: Reading data from another service is often best done via HTTP.

Cons

- Tight coupling and cascading failures: If the callee is slow/down, callers suffer; can cause retry storms.
- No atomicity across services: You can’t make one distributed transaction; partial failure is a risk.
- Complex resilience in the caller: Backoff, jitter, timeouts, circuit breaker, idempotency keys—plus the “error box” and replayer.
- Operational toil shifts to you: You build and operate your own DLQ-like system for failed calls.

Best when

- You truly need synchronous confirmation (e.g., user-facing step can’t proceed without a reply).
- You’re performing queries (reads) between services.
- Low call volume or low coupling risk (bounded blast radius).

Key practices

- Resilience policies: retries with exponential backoff + jitter, short timeouts, circuit breakers.
- Idempotency keys on write endpoints (so retries don’t double-apply).
- Error box/replay service: durable store + replayer with rate limits and safety checks.
- Bulkhead isolation and load shedding to avoid cascading failure.

## Hybrid guidance for your architecture

Given HouseService is the source of truth for Houses/Rooms and TemperatureService maintains replicas:

- Use outbox + bus for writes/changes:

  - HouseService: persist domain changes + outbox row; dispatcher publishes HouseCreated/Updated/Deleted and Room\* events to the broker.
  - TemperatureService: consume events and update its read model. This matches your MessageContracts and MassTransit setup and delivers reliable, scalable sync.

- Use synchronous HTTP for reads:

  - If the frontend or another service needs a specific snapshot (query), call the owner service’s API directly. Keep these read calls resilient but lightweight.
  - Where possible, prefer querying the local read model (TemperatureService) to reduce cross-service chatter.

- For workflows that need immediate coordination:

  - Avoid chaining synchronous writes across services. Instead, model long-running, multi-step updates as sagas (orchestrated via messages), or accept eventual consistency with clear UX.
  - Only use sync write calls when the UX absolutely needs it; wrap with idempotency + resilience and consider a narrow-scope error box.

- Operationally:
  - Outbox dispatcher metrics: lag, failures, replays.
  - Broker: DLQ monitoring, consumer lag, retry counts.
  - Consumers: idempotency, handler latency, error rates.
  - For any sync calls you keep: timeouts, retry caps, circuit breaker open rate, and error box drain rates.

## Decision matrix (rule of thumb)

- Many consumers need the change? → Outbox + bus.
- Caller needs immediate response to proceed? → Sync call (with idempotency + resilience); keep rare.
- Data read/query only? → Sync HTTP is fine; cache where helpful.
- High-throughput writes or bursty loads? → Outbox + bus handles backpressure better.
- Simple system, low load, few services? → Sync can be enough, but plan a path to async as you scale.

## Recommendation for HouseProject

- Keep and lean into your current Outbox + Message Bus model for domain changes between HouseService and TemperatureService.
- Reserve synchronous calls for read endpoints and occasional control-plane operations that truly require immediate confirmation.
- Ensure consumers are idempotent, and consider a consumer-side inbox/deduplication strategy.
- If you retain any critical sync write calls, implement: idempotency keys, Polly-like resilience (retry/backoff/circuit breaker), and a small error box + replay job with guardrails.
